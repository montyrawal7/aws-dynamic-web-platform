\# Dynamic Web Platform – Solutions Architect Project



\## Overview

This project simulates a small business web platform that allows users to browse products, place orders, and receive order confirmations. The goal is to design and implement a secure, scalable, and cost-aware cloud architecture on AWS.



\## Business Problem

A small online retailer needs a reliable and scalable web platform to handle customer orders, ensure high availability, and send order confirmations — without managing physical infrastructure.



\## Requirements

\- Highly available across multiple AZs

\- Scalable based on traffic

\- Secure network design

\- Low-cost and free-tier friendly

\- Observable and monitorable

\- Fault tolerant



\## Planned Architecture

\- Application Load Balancer

\- Auto Scaling Group with EC2 instances

\- VPC with public and private subnets

\- Security Groups and IAM roles

\- SNS for order notifications

\- CloudWatch for monitoring



\## Phases

1\. Build and test the app locally

2\. Deploy on EC2

3\. Add Load Balancer + Auto Scaling

4\. Add monitoring and alerts

5\. Harden security and optimize cost
